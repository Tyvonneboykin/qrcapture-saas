            QRCapture was built with a simple mission: help local businesses grow their customer lists without the friction of app downloads or complicated signup forms.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We noticed that restaurants, bars, and lounges were missing out on valuable customer connections. Guests would visit, have a great time, and leave—never to be seen again. There was no easy way to stay in touch.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Traditional solutions required app downloads, complicated loyalty programs, or intrusive data collection. We knew there had to be a better way.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            QRCapture is that better way. A simple QR code that any smartphone can scan, leading to a quick form where customers can opt-in to receive updates. No apps, no friction, just connection.
        </p>
